# QA-Chatbot: Local File Question Answering with LLM APIs

üí¨ **Query PDFs, Excel, and Word files locally using Hugging Face LLMs. Secure, fast, and user-friendly.**

---

## Overview

QA-Chatbot allows users to **upload documents locally** and interact with them through **natural language queries** using large language models (LLMs). Unlike typical RAG-based chatbots:

- ‚ùå **No vector database**
- ‚ùå **No chunking or embedding**
- ‚ö° Files are processed **on-the-fly** for instant answers
- üîê Users provide their **own API keys**, ensuring security and no premium requirement

## Key Features

- **Local File Querying:** Upload PDFs, Excel sheets, or Word documents.  
- **LLM-powered Answers:** Uses Hugging Face models for on-demand queries.  
- **Safe API Key Usage:** Users supply their own tokens ‚Äî keys are **never stored**.  
- **Optional Test Mode:** `test.py` verifies API connectivity and answer functionality.  
- **Excel Intelligence:** Supports natural language filtering, aggregation, trends, and basic visualization.  
- **Optimized Excel Handling:** Many queries can be performed **directly on Excel files** without requiring heavy LLM processing, making regular data operations faster and more efficient.

## How It Works

1. **File Upload & Storage:**  
   - Files are stored **temporarily in `uploads/`**.  
   - No permanent storage; data exists only for the current session.  
   - **Excel files** can often be queried directly for counts, sums, averages, trends, etc., without needing API calls ‚Äî this reduces unnecessary LLM usage.

2. **Query Processing:**  
   - Excel: Sheets parsed, columns normalized, filters and aggregations applied.  
   - PDF/Word: Text extracted and queried directly by LLM.

3. **LLM Interaction:**  
   - Uses Hugging Face LLMs to answer queries when needed.  
   - Users enter API keys **securely in the app**, never saved.

4. **Answer Display:**  
   - Streamlit shows answers directly.  
   - Excel results can be downloaded as CSV or Excel files.

## Why This Is Different

- **Not a typical RAG chatbot:** No embeddings, vector DB, or chunking.  
- **On-demand querying:** Each question processed independently.  
- **User-controlled security:** Only user API keys are used ‚Äî safe and flexible.
